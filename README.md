CodeInSync is a lightweight, vanilla PHP application that functions as a dynamic, windowed workspace for managing code, clients, projects, and development tasks ‚Äî without the overhead of a traditional framework.
<h3>‚öôÔ∏è Features</h3>
<p><ul><li>Modular App Architecture: Self-contained app.*.php and ui.*.php files are loaded dynamically using output buffering and sorted into draggable windows via JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Project-Aware Context Switching: Intelligent directory detection via APP_PATH and APP_ROOT lets Git and Composer commands execute in project-specific contexts ‚Äî useful for managing multiple client setups.</li>
    <li>Built-in Terminal: Run inline PHP commands or php -r scripts directly from the browser. eval() is sandboxed for testing and debugging, with support for WebSocket socket server communication for longer processes.</li>
    <li>Time & Activity Tracking: Background JavaScript monitors idle times and logs activity to JSON-based timesheets, providing historical views of work habits per project.</li>
    <li>Graph View (d3.js): Visualize project architecture with dynamic JSON-based node maps showing file relationships, includes, and app dependencies.</li>
    <li>Socket-Ready Execution: Offload heavy or interactive tasks to a separate PHP socket server (WSL-ready) with real-time status feedback via WebSockets.</li>
    <li>Zero Refresh UI: All internal navigation is handled via JavaScript and AJAX ‚Äî iframe-free and fast.</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>üß† Why No Framework (Yet)?</h3>

This app was intentionally built with vanilla PHP for speed, transparency, and full control. It's a dev tool, not a product ‚Äî by developers, for developers. Frameworks like Laravel can be bolted on later if business logic or API complexity demands it.

The code has the ability to operate in a root directory (/public_html/) scenario, but only on initial install of the program, it corrects itself into a project root directory(project/[config|public]), where the configuration files are in in config, and the web code is under public. I learned in this course of work how to use .htaccess mod rewrite, and being able to change the url in order for [project/index.php] and [project/public/index.php] can still result in see the same thing.

I have a set of tools that I want to be able to replicate, as well as having 1 click solutions. Git is my next project, and then php. And then I have a terminal program I am working on for skeleton. I might just put it all into 1 project here on github. You can see at the end of the gif animation, that I have basic animation skills. Enough that I can create simple screen grab videos.
