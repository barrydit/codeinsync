Front-end interface for php composer and git (push/pull). I intend to make it a lot simplier to install php libraries from packagist and github, and that I wanted to be able to just plug the code into it, and make it work. I also wanted to show my skills off. I realize there are many other peoples content/images that are copyrighted, but if you ask nicely, they will be removed.

The code has the ability to operate in a root directory (/public_html/) scenario, but only on initial install of the program, it corrects itself into a project root directory(project/[config|public]), where the configuration files are in in config, and the web code is under public. I learned in this course of work how to use .htaccess mod rewrite, and being able to change the url in order for [project/index.php] and [project/public/index.php] can still result in see the same thing.

I have a set of tools that I want to be able to replicate, as well as having 1 click solutions. Git is my next project, and then php. And then I have a terminal program I am working on for skeleton. I might just put it all into 1 project here on github. You can see at the end of the gif animation, that I have basic animation skills. Enough that I can create simple screen grab videos.
